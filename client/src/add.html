             To incentivize users to sell their compute resources, pricing contracts are created during the creation of a new task/job between the requester and each provider. This immutable contract specifies the cost per byte per time period that the provider charges for hosting the job. Additionally, it contains the price per byte transferred which determines the price for each byte uploaded or downloaded. This simple pricing helps to ensure that providers are incentivized to run a requester's task in the long term and to be online and available as much as possible to collect data transfer fees.
